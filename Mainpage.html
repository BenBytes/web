Strife Eu is a PC gaming clan that heavily focusses on the game Destiny 2.
Even though our focus lies upon Destiny we still welcome all games and
we play very different games from time to time, a great example of this
would be our Starcraft 2 inhouse tournament in which we all make fun of
our-selves for not being capable of playing the game. Another example
for this clan existing beyond the borders of destiny is that we have
any people that frequently go and play other games like PUBG together
which can on demand as well be organized via a discord channel. I think
the best way I have of explaining how this group of very different people
works is probably a quote from out Founder and clan leader Defwish:” We 
have an absolutely brilliant bunch of people here. We only exist and make 
people stay because of the people. There is no other reason.”This bunch 
of people is organized via discord and lead and organized by the admin-team 
and Def-wish. These are responsible for keeping everything running and enforcing 
the rules. And yes, there are rules, however we never have something against 
some good shitpost.As the name suggests we are a clan based in the 
EU while a majority of our members is from the UK, we have quite a few 
people from different European countries and even some completely 
dif-ferent countries that roughly share our time zone.

So, as Destiny 2 is our home I will dedicate this section to it. Essentially, 
we are a really all-round clan which results in us not just having a single 
focus like PVE or PVP we do everything, mostly endgame activities. We have 
multiple raids going on each week and depending on content released by Bungie, 
you might even see multiple a day. Since we are well spread between activities, 
we get a great variety since you might just hop into something that you aren’t 
usually doing and find some-thing new for yourself. We do as well have few bits 
of artificial content, with that I mean that we like to create our own challenges 
this includes speedruns, pvp tournaments and even raid races are on the table. 
For these kinds of activities, we heavily rely on the creative input from the 
players, while our admins come up with their own ideas and events we still like 
to realise the ideas of play-ers or support them in realising them themselves. 
Important to note is that our discord often proves to be a valuable tool as we 
have a bunch of people that know the game very well so if you want to learn a 
raid or any other activity you will likely find a guide. On top of that we have 
multiple channels dedicated to sharing information about raids and talking 
about weapon rolls and loadouts.
