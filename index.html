          <h2>About this clan</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Strife Eu is a PC gaming clan that heavily focusses on the game Destiny 2. Even though our focus lies upon Destiny we still welcome all games and we play very different games from time to time, a great example of this would be our Starcraft 2 inhouse tournament in which we all make fun of our-selves for not being capable of playing the game. Another example for this clan existing beyond the borders of destiny is that we have any people that frequently go and play other games like PUBG together which can on demand as well be organized via a discord channel. I think the best way I have of explaining how this group of very different people works is probably a quote from out Founder and clan leader Defwish:” We have an absolutely brilliant bunch of people here. We only exist and make people stay because of the people. There is no other reason.”           This bunch of people is organized via discord and lead and organized by the admin-team and Def-wish. These are responsible for keeping everything running and enforcing the rules. And yes, there are rules, however we never have something against some good shitpost.            As the name suggests we are a clan based in the EU while a majority of our members is from the UK, we have quite a few people from different European countries and even some completely dif-ferent countries that roughly share our time zone.

          <h2>Us in Destiny 2</h2>
          <p class="lead">So, as Destiny 2 is our home I will dedicate this section to it. Essentially, we are a really all-round clan which results in us not just having a single focus like PVE or PVP we do everything, mostly endgame activities. We have multiple raids going on each week and depending on content released by Bungie, you might even see multiple a day. Since we are well spread between activities, we get a great variety since you might just hop into something that you aren’t usually doing and find some-thing new for yourself. We do as well have few bits of artificial content, with that I mean that we like to create our own challenges this includes speedruns, pvp tournaments and even raid races are on the table. For these kinds of activities, we heavily rely on the creative input from the players, while our admins come up with their own ideas and events we still like to realise the ideas of play-ers or support them in realising them themselves. Important to note is that our discord often proves to be a valuable tool as we have a bunch of people that know the game very well so if you want to learn a raid or any other activity you will likely find a guide. On top of that we have multiple channels dedicated to sharing information about raids and talking about weapon rolls and loadouts. </p>

          <h2>General community rules</h2>
          <p class="lead">These are our general community roles, more and game specific rules can be found in our discord in the #welocme-page</p>
          <ul>
              <li>             
                  1) Be civil and treat each other with respect. Treat others with respect and you will receive the same courtesy.
            </li>
              <li>             
                  2) Whilst banter is fine, we will not tolerate racism, xenophobia, sexism and homophobia. Links back to the first rule, treat each other with respect. Keep it to yourself and out of the server. 
             </li>
             <li>             
                  3) Do not direct message other members with the intent of starting an argument, especially targeting anything included in rule 2.
            </li>
              <li>             
                  4) No advertising other community servers similar to ours. If someone is advertising another server and trying to poach members from Strife into a different server, please message a Mod or defwhish with screenshots of the advert. Poaching members is a serious offense and you may be booted instantly.
            </li>
              <li>             
                  5) If a mod or def tell you to drop a topic or conversation, drop it. They will have said it for a reason, maybe things are touchy or getting too heated. Mods will try to remain neutral on situations. Failure to heed what a mod has said may result in a warning being given
